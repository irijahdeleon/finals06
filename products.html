          <p>ALLOY is Avalon's inaugural deck of playing cards. Following a series of 72 iterations and design explorations, it emerged as a foundational component within Avalon's brand design language. The back design, characterized by a fusion of "Hyperealism" and Y2K aesthetics, draws upon brutalism as its core framework. Minimal design elements enhance its appearance, providing embellishment to an otherwise unconventional object.</p>
